Every packages has been imported to the notebook file and the system has to have these installed. The packages which are uncommon are listed in the notebook which are installed in the running time.

For example, 

- **!pip install tensorflow_hub**
- **!pip install tensorflow_text**

The notebook file can be easily run to reproduce the results as shown on the report. The pre-run outputs are still demonstrated on the notebook file.
